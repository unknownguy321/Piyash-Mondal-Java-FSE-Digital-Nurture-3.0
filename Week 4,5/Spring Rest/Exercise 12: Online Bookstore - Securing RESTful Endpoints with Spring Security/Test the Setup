Authentication: Make a POST request to /api/authenticate with a valid username and password to obtain a JWT token.
Accessing Secure Endpoints: Use the obtained JWT token as a Bearer token in the Authorization header to access secure endpoints.

Example of a Secure Request:

GET /api/books HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token_here
